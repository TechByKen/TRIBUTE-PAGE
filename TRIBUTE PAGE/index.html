      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li>
          <b>Early life</b> - M. K. O. Abiola was born in Abeokuta, Ogun State
          to the family of Salawu and Suliat Wuraola Abiola in 24 August 1937.
          His father was a produce trader who primarily traded cocoa, and his
          mother traded in kola nuts. His name, Kashimawo, means "Let us wait
          and see". Moshood Abiola was his father's twenty-third child, but the
          first of them to survive infancy, hence the name 'Kashimawo'. It was
          not until he was fifteen that he was properly named Moshood by his
          parents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Business career</b> - In 1956 Moshood Abiola started his
          professional life as a bank clerk with Barclays Bank in Ibadan,
          South-West Nigeria. After two years he joined the Western Region
          Finance Corporation as an executive accounts officer, before leaving
          for Glasgow, Scotland, to pursue his higher education. From Glasgow
          University he received a first class degree in accountancy, and he
          also gained a distinction from the Institute of Chartered Accountants
          of Scotland. On his return to Nigeria, Abiola worked as a senior
          accountant at the University of Lagos Teaching Hospital, then went on
          to US firm Pfizer, before joining the ITT Corporation, where he later
          rose to the position of vice-president, Africa and Middle-East. Abiola
          spent a lot of his time, and made most of his money, in the United
          States, while retaining the post of chairman of the corporation's
          Nigerian subsidiary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ITT</b> - While Abiola worked at the Nigerian subsidiary of Pfizer
          smile pharmaceuticals, his desire was to own some equity in the firm
          but the options available to him were not appealing. He then applied
          to a job listing seeking a trained accountant, it was during the
          interview that he found out the firm was ITT Corporation. Abiola was
          employed by the firm and one of his immediate responsibilities was to
          clear the backlog of debt owed to the firm by the military.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Election</b> - For the 12 June 1993 presidential elections,
          Abiola's running mate was his primary opponent Baba Gana Kingibe. He
          defeated his rival, Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention.
          The election was declared Nigeria's freeest and fairest presidential
          election by national and international observers, with Abiola even
          winning in his Northern opponent's home state of Kano. Abiola won at
          the national capital, Abuja, the military polling stations, and over
          two-thirds of Nigerian states. Men of Northern descent had largely
          dominated Nigeria's political landscape since independence; Moshood
          Abiola, a Western Muslim, was able to secure a national mandate freely
          and fairly, unprecedented in Nigeria's history. However, the election
          was annulled by Ibrahim Babangida, causing a political crisis which
          led to General Sani Abacha seizing power later that year. During
          preparations for the 2011 Nigerian Presidential elections there were
          calls from several quarters to remember MKO Abiola.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Imprisonment</b> - In 1994 Moshood Abiola, M.K.O. declared himself
          the lawful president of Nigeria in the Epetedo area of Lagos island,
          an area mainly populated by (Yoruba) Lagos Indigenes. He had recently
          returned from a trip to win the support of the international community
          for his mandate. After declaring himself president he was declared
          wanted and was accused of treason and arrested on the orders of
          military President General Sani Abacha, who sent 200 police vehicles
          to bring him into custody. M.K.O. Abiola has been referred to as
          Nigeria's greatest statesman.[44] His second wife Alhaja Kudirat
          Abiola was assassinated in Lagos in 1996 after declaring public
          support for her husband.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Death</b> - Moshood Abiola died unexpectedly, shortly after the
          death of General Abacha, on the day that he was due to be
          released.[48] While meeting group of American diplomats including
          Thomas Pickering and Susan Rice at a government guesthouse in Abuja,
          Abiola fell ill and died. Rice had served tea to Abiola shortly before
          his collapse, and later wrote of an enduring belief in Nigeria that
          she had poisoned Abiola
